learnmytimestablesforadults
===========================

Developmentment for this project has been picked back up from the original developer. This project will be released, Version 0.0.2. 
The date for development is unknown, but sometime in May. 

This will also be made in Python 2.7. 
The reason this program was originally stopped was because the developer wanted to add advanced features he did not feel he was ready for, but now he thinks he is ready. 

For now, the old version of Learn My Times Tables will still be online, but a new name for this project is also being considered. 

Version 0.0.2 will solely be focused on Linux, therefore, we will discontinue support for Windows and Mac. If someone wishes to port to windows and mac, they are more than glad to do so, but for it wont be released in V 0.0.2. (We want to take babysteps)

offical docs will be published once more development is underway.
