#TimesTablesplus V2 
TimesTablesPlus (Formerly Learn My Times Tables for Adults)
===========================
Welcome to the TimesTablesPlus Github. This project has been revamped from the ground up to incorporate its conversion from desktop to android. This application can be found on the Google Playstore. It's 100% free and incorporates the Kivy Framework for Python 2.7. We chose the Pyhon and Kivy because of its ability to creates prototypes quickily and because we can create the desktop application and mobile application at the same time. We sincerely hope you enjoy the project. If you wish to contribute on this project we could use any help you can offer. Please consult our developer guide to help.

# Installation
