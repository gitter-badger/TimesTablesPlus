# Welcome to TimesTablePlus!
This application is being completely re-written from top to bottom. We aim to have a beautiful UX experience and a meaningful way for people to learn the times tables. Our application is not geared toward children, but rather adult learners. We hope that by shipping this product we can help adult learners achieve more in math! 

# Contribute:
We could use your help! Currently we need some core developers to help with development. To help please establish communication with us on (TBA)

# Our Stack:
Ruby 2.0: Very beutiful language(Yes, it can be used for things non web related)
Shoes4: Nice GUI framework.

# Our Timeline:
We are hoping for a July closed-beta release. August public release. We will start at 0.0.1-beta. (Previous versions are no longer considered canon as this will be a entirely new development from the scratch.) 

#Past version
The past version is no longer being updated. We strongly advise against downloading it because it is riddled with bugs. We decided to not delete it because of how other people also worked on it. So it is in the previous_version branch.
